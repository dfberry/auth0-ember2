# Summary 
This is a basic emberjs 2 app with Logging in with the Lock widget

# TBD - editing
For now these are notes - I'll edit for more clarity/description later - just want to get the steps down as I figure them out

# scriptable install would be nice

* install nodejs
* install bower
* install emberjs
* ember new [projectname]
* cd [projectname]
* npm install - verify this
* bower install - verify this
* ember serve - shows generic/basic ember app - port is 4200
* ember generate template application - creates handlebars template named application
* add title and button to /[projectname]/app/templates/application.hbs>


<h3>auth0 Login via Lock Widget</h3>
<input id="btn-login" class="btn-login" type="submit" value="Login"/>


* add session to ember
* add route, etc for authenticated request
* add route, etc for unauthenticated request
* add css/js, etc for lock widget to work - not sure what this involves right now 
* make sure dashboard has 2 major settings for authorized callback urls & allowed origins (cors) - not sure I have these formatted correctly right now

# Markdown isn't quite right
TBD - not using Github flavor at moment
